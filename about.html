        <h5>Introduction:</h5>
        <p>
          My name is Nathaniel (I usually go by Nathan) Atkins. I'm a junior
          web developer, composer, songwriter, music producer, and sound
          designer. Although I do quite a bit in regards to audio, considering
          I've been doing that for about 8 years, I'm beginning to focus my
          attention more on being a web developer. I began my journey in web
          development in June of 2020. That was when I began my cohort at
          Eleven Fifty Academy, a school which teaches coding of all sorts,
          from the web development pathway that I took, to software
          development and even cyber security. As for my music background, I
          began making music back in 2012 as a hobby and have continued
          growing in that field ever since. I'm primarily self taught, and
          have improved in my abilities quite a bit over the years. If you
          continue reading below, I've written individual articles going over
          my history in both web development and music production.

          As previously mentioned, I began my adventure into web development
          in June of 2020. I attended Eleven Fifty Academy, which not only
          educated me in regards to the knowledge I know today, but also
          taught me to pursue more knowledge on my own. I loved to find out
          new methods of doing things in programming before they were even
          formally taught to me. If I wanted something done, I'd spend my
          night Googling away, asking my instructors for help, as well as
          asking other programmers for help on public forums and Discord
          servers. I felt like I couldn't rest until I figured out what I
          needed to figure out. One thing that helped me greatly when I began
          Eleven Fifty was actually the knowledge which I had attained before
          even beginning the course. I took it upon myself to look into Python
          as a way to get my feet wet before diving into my programming
          journey. I learned quite a bit from various online courses and video
          tutorials. It made it siginificantly easier to understand concepts
          in JavaScript, considering I had basically already learned them from
          using those concepts in Python. If you wish to see the projects I've
          completed while at Eleven Fifty, you can view them by clicking on
          the "Projects" tab, or by scrolling down.

      <div class="Music Production">
        <h5>Music Production</h5>
        Back in 2012, just a month or so before I began high school, I decided
        that I wanted to pursue electronic music production. I had been into
        electronic music in general for several years before making this
        decision, and had an interest in music dating far before even that. I
        had some experience before beginning this adventure into music, mainly
        from playing clarinet in band class, but really wasn't prepared yet
        for the journey I'd be taking on. In all honesty, I didn't even know
        where I was supposed to begin. I didn't know what tools I'd need and
        what I'd need to learn as far as music knowledge went. So I began by
        simply Googling "How to make Dubstep" into Google, as an aspiring
        young music producer would. I was immediately met with the information
        I was looking for, and everything seemed like it was attainable enough
        at first, but then I saw the price tags. That's when I decided the
        best course of action was to get to work raising up some money. I
        ended up gaining enough money from chores (remember, I was like a
        freshman in high school at this point) to eventually get myself a
        decent enough computer to make music on, but before that even
        happened, something else did. Early into my journey, my wonderful
        parents acknowledged my drive towards wanting to make music and
        decided they'd get the me standard version of Ableton Live as a
        Christmas gift. This would turn out to be one of those coin flip
        moments in life that would determine my future. Immediately I began
        trying to work with music. I expiremented extensively with everything
        inside of Ableton, looked up countless videos on how to do specific
        things, and did a lot of Googling of terms, trying to figure out what
        all the knobs do. At first I didn't really have much of a grasp at
        music theory and instead just tried to put together notes that sounded
        good. After a bunch of experimenting over the course of 2 years or so,
        I eventually began getting halfway decent at creating music. Overtime,
        I continued to progress, and now after 8 years of doing this, I've
        gotten to where I am today.
